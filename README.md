SMART HOME DESIGNER
The idea of ​​The “Smart Home Designer” project :  

 

 Is to assist designers or people who want to design Their -homes and offices- with help of experts and specialists in This field, through a 3D view That gives The customers The ability to visualize the virtual image of what They wants on the real world . Throw the following main functions are arranged sequentially depending on how the software works: 

Enter information 

It is a basic and important process of design by allows users enter the specifications of the room to be designed. 

Submission of proposals 

The appropriate suggestions and guidelines for users based on the specifications and information entered in the previous phase those guidelines are presented by studying the spaces and developing appropriate solutions. 

The presentation in three - dimensional 

Presentation of the final design based on the specifications entered and that presented in 3D allows the users to see their design from different angles. 

 

The program offers a variety of design options and consultations tailored to The customer to save The cost of consulting The designers, It includes a Database that can expand and add to the models of design and furniture, and provides a 3D view gives The customer The ability to embody Imaginary picture of what they wants of design at The real world. 

 

The process begins with the user selecting The option (new empty design) to start creating a new design, then the design and furnishing steps, starting with specifying the room specifications (Length ,width and Height) and choosing the suitable materials from pre-prepared menus. Then the option (Create) to move to the furnishing process, the user choosing furniture from menus with many options available, then arranged by the drag-and-drop process with the possibility of scaling these pieces to match the size of the space, and finally the usurers can review what they designed by 3D View and different angles by clicking on an icon (view), to embody what They imagined before they executed It on the real world. 

The user can use ready designs to create new designs then add them to the database to use them later. 

 

 

 

Objectives of the Smart Home Designer program: 

 

Is to serve -home and office- owners, and designers in The interior design process by providing faster and easier electronic design, It save time, effort and cost. 

In the case of commercial use, It increase sales by urging customers to design Their rooms and homes and see what It will be before the start of The purchase . 

Smart Home Designer serve designers by minimize potential errors during design. It also presents the latest developments and innovations in the field of interior design. 

 

Software used in the Smart Home Designer program are: 

 

Windows operating system 

Microsoft Visual Studio  

Microsoft SQL Server  

TV3D SDK 6.3 

TV3D SDK 6. 

 

The Smart Home Designer program has been in several phases: 

  1) Collecting information, which includes the questionnaire and document analysis, we have reached to this result 

Smart Home Designer program has been encouraged by expert designers and designers with intermediate design experience who have experience at using the computer in terms of providing privacy, time, money and effort, while not agreeing that it could be a substitute for human designers or an alternative to traditional interior design, It is an assistant and complementary to it. 

There is a strong desire of people to have flexible electronic programs helps  in the interior design and furnishing, including the basic functions of delete, modifies and adds, and provides a semi-realistic picture of what is required. 

Desire of people to have a simple, unconventional method used in interior design and furnishing available to a large segment of people. 

 

2) Then the modeling phase for the program inclusive functional modeling includes : Data Flow Diagram (DFD), Context Diagram ,Zero level Diagram , Lower Level Diagrams. Data Modeling includes: Entity Relationship Model (ER), Logical Database Design, Physical Database Design. Behavioral modeling includes: Use Case Diagram, Analysis Diagram, and Sequence Diagram.  

3) The phase of creating the system algorithm by applying flowchart 

4) Finally, the system was tested using Black-Box Testing and White-Box Testing.  The system inputs and outputs were tested by Black-Box While all the important conditions and loops in the system have been verified and tested By White-Box Testing By entering an input and tracking it until we get to the desired output from this function, this indicates that the function is functioning correctly.  

Also a sample of users was selected to test the system, the basis of the results of this test can be concluded that the system has a good degree of flexibility and an average ease of learning 

In addition to: 

1- Coordinate the program interfaces and icons with the idea of the program. 

2 - The ability of the program to save the effort and money of the user and facilitate the design process. 

3. The effectiveness and ease of use of the 3D presentation by providing a realistic picture of what is needed. 

4. Support the user in the design process through the instructions. 

5 - Easy to execute commands required in general for all parts of the program. 

6. The user's interaction with the program is flexible and effective. 

 

Project constraints: 

 One of the main obstacles was faced is the lack of images and objects of the mesh type, which is supported by the TRUEVISION3D LIBRARY used in the system to make 3D presentations difficult to obtain, limiting the possibilities and options of the program. 

We tried to solve this problem by getting 3D images and objects with a (.max) or (.3d ) extension, and converting them into mesh objects with an (.x) extension, using programs such as 3DEXPLORATION and 3DMAX, but that did not completely solve the problem. Other problems appear after conversion - in some objects - related to the size and shape of the object. 

 Recommendations and future plans: 

add  layout of the room shapes with doors and windows in them, from which the user chooses the most appropriate layout before the start of the design process, with the possibility to modify it to fit the desired format, this option is important to make the program  more integrated, more efficient and effective. 

Provide user control in the colors and materials of furniture as desired, and not adhere to specific options. 

The user is enabled to control and modify the design during the three-dimensional display not just before. 

Increasing the scope of the internal design guidelines to include the furnishing process in many aspects and the use of artificial intelligence in this, this increases its efficiency.
